/**
 * Fuber
 * FuberTaxiService.java
 * Purpose: Webservice to manage taxis
 * You are the proprietor of f√ºber, an on call taxi service.
 *You have a fleet of cabs at your disposal, and each cab has a location, 
 *determined by it's latitude and longitude.
 * A customer can call one of your taxis by providing their location, 
 * and you must assign the nearest taxi to the customer.
 *Some customers are particular that they only ride around in pink cars, for hipster reasons. 
 *You must support this ability.
 *When the cab is assigned to the customer, it can no longer pick up any other customers
 *If there are no taxis available, you reject the customers request.
 *The customer ends the ride at some location. The cab waits around outside the customer's house, 
 *and is available to be assigned to another customer.
 *Notes:
 *You can build this in any programming language of your choice
 *We expect good unit tests
 *Unfortunately, you skipped Geography, and believe the earth is flat. 
 *The distance between two points can be calculated by Pythagoras' theorem.
 *We don't expect a front end for this, but try to build an restful API.
